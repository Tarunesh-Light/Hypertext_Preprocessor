OOPS - Object-Oriented Programming

Procedural Programming - Writing procedures or functions(we procedurally create it) that perform operations on the data whereas
in Object-Oriented programming we create objects which contains both data and functions 

Class - Contains properties and methods

Access Modifiers/Visibility Modifiers- private,public and protected 

Private - Parameters can be accessed only within the Class
Protected - Child class inherited from the parent class can have access tho the parameters of the parent class 
Public - Anyone will have access to the variables

this - Denotes the object which has called the class.Used to allocate values to properties/variables of a 
class inside methods of a class

Constructor Syntax - public function __construct(){}

this example - $this->name = $name;

require_once 'FILE_PATH';     //To access class in php file from anywhere

Eg:- require_once 'PHP\Hypertext_Preprocessor\OOPS.php 
Then you can access the class normally

Eg:- class name extends age {}
name class(child class) get access to all the properties and methods of age class(parent class).
